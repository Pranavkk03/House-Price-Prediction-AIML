# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using a Machine Learning model.
The system takes input features such as area, number of bedrooms, age of house, and location rating, and predicts the estimated price.

## Problem Statement
Accurate property valuation is difficult in the real estate market.
Manual estimation is inconsistent and time-consuming.
This project provides a data-driven solution for predicting house prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Linear Regression

## Dataset Features
- Area (sq ft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Age of House
- Location Rating
- Price (Target Variable)

## How to Run the Project

1. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn

2. Run the project:
python main.py

3. Enter house details when prompted.

## Output
The system displays:
- Model R² Score
- Estimated house price based on user input

## Future Improvements
- Use larger real-world dataset
- Apply advanced ML algorithms
- Develop web-based interface
